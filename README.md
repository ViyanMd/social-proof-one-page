## Acknowledgments

The challenge is absolutely great for beginners. Just when you think you know everything, it makes you a little more humble. Overall I haven't struggled much with it,
the only thing I wish was different (or extra) is a tablet design, because this type of "crooked" design is pretty difficult to make responsive. Anyways, desktop and mobile 
versions look pretty good. I think I will get back to it when I have more time to make it complete.
